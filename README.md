## Research Challenges and Bottlenecks

The following challenges summarize a large body of work, please check the specific citations in my paper

1. Generalization gap: traces differ across generation methods; models overfit dataset-specific features; lack universal forged-feature representations
2. Robustness in real-world conditions: forged traces may be weakened by compression; models trained on high-quality data do not generalize well to low-quality data; lack of diverse training data in real-world scenarios
3. Vulnerability to adversarial attacks: detectors themselves can be vulnerable; lack of adversarial training; detection features easily circumvented
4. Real-time and computational efficiency: heavy feature extraction and fusion pipelines; lack of model compression and optimization; multimodal processing requires more compute
5. Multimodal fusion complexity: large differences between modality feature spaces; lack of effective cross-modal alignment; asynchronous processing due to network delays or compression
